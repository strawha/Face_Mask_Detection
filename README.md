## FaceMaskDetection

The system uses YOLO, harcascade classifier and a custom built CNN to identify face mask in realtime. 

Sample Output can be seen [here] (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1UGTnCTJiZRs7s6BzA6x8f78V3zOGY46h) 

Pre-requisites for execution:

Download Yolo network weights 'yolo.h5' from [here](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/yolo.h5) and place it in same directory as yolo_detection.py

Install imageai library to load YOLO model [link](https://anaconda.org/powerai/imageai)
